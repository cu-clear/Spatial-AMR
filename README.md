# Spatial-AMR

Spatial AMR extends the 2019 version of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to allow fine-grained spatial semantics and pragmatics from grounded, multimodal corpora to be incorporated into the graphs; there is a special focus on annotating linguistic frame of reference (FoR). 

Spatial AMR was developed using the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus, in which sets of two particpants-- a Builder and and Architect-- collaborate in building a wide array of block structures in Minecraft. In recording the dialogues, the MALMO platform recorded entity locations and orientations in the 3D, Cartesian framework of the Minecraft environment, as well as screenshots from 6 angles for each dialogue act and each block placement action. This grounding data is represented in the annotations, but is also available in raw form in the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus links below.

* In the upper-left drop-down menu, select 'AMR Spatial 1.0'. This will filter the rolesets to the full set of English rolesets used in Spatial AMR annotation, including those with special spatial semantics.
* A limited inventory of just the spatial-semantics rolesets will presented separately in the Spatial AMR Github repository-- coming soon
