# Spatial-AMR

Spatial AMR extends the 2019 version of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to allow fine-grained spatial semantics and pragmatics from grounded, multimodal corpora to be incorporated into the graphs. There is a special focus on annotating linguistic frame of reference (FoR). 

The project adds ~200 new PropBank rolesets for spatial relations and eventualities. For 'directed' spatial relations (those that refer to a direction, like 'behind', 'in front of', etc.), rolesets include new roles for identifying spatial frameworks.

* In the upper-left drop-down menu, select 'AMR Spatial 1.0'. This will filter the rolesets to the full set of English rolesets used in Spatial AMR annotation, including those with special spatial semantics.
* A limited inventory of just the spatial-semantics rolesets will presented separately in the Spatial AMR Github repository.
